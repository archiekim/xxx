1. Everything is an object
2. A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages.
3. Each object has its own memory made up of other objects.(composite class)
4. Every object has a type.(class struct union enum)
5. All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages.(inheritance, shape->circle, shape->square)

virtual : late binding / polymorphism / extensible


Keep the habit of recording.

design and analysis -> test coding

Phase 0: Make a plan
- make milestones to check the status of proejct between start and end.

The mission statement
- high concept (of movie) : a summary of movie that can attract people to go into theater.
- high concept == mission statement

Phase 1: What are we making?
- Think about the actual use case. THis will give lots of idea what the project has to be.
- Who will use this sytem?
- What can those actors do with the system?
- How does this actor do that with this sytem?
- How else might this work if someone else were doing this, or if the same actor had a different objective?
- What problem might happen while doing this with the system?

bog : swamp Shrek

Phase 2: How will we build it?
-CRC : Class/Responsiblity/Collaboration


Five stages of object design
1. Object discovery
2. Object assembly
3. System construction
4. System extension
5. Object reuse


Guidelines for object development


Phase 3: Build the core

Phase 4: Iterate the use cases
-Stakeholder : stake holder / connected party

Phase 5: Evolution
- pristine : clean, almost perfect, not-polluted
- latitude : freedom, 

Plans pay off



Extreme programming
- Write tests first
- relegate : demote
- cordon : Demonstrators broke through the police cordon.
           Police cordoned off the area until the bomb was made safe.
- cackle : They all cackled with delight. giggle.
- glee : delight
         cackling with glee.
